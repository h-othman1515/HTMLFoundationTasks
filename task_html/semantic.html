<!-- Exercise 5-3:
1. Create a file `semantic.html`.
2. Structure a mock **personal blog** page using:
    - `<header>` with a site title
    - `<nav>` with 3 links (Home, Blog, Contact)
    - `<section>` containing two `<article>`s (each with a heading & paragraph)
    - `<aside>` with “About Me” text
    - `<footer>` with copyright info
3. Compare the same layout using only `<div>` tags and notice how less readable it is. -->

<!-- Exercise 5-4:
1. Enhance the `semantic.html` file:
    - Add `aria-label` to your `<nav>` for screen readers.
    - Add `alt` text to any images.
    - Ensure headings follow a proper hierarchy (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`).
2. Run your page through an **online accessibility checker** and fix any issues. -->
