<!-- Exercise 2-1:
1. Create a new file `about.html`.
2. In the `<head>` section, add:
    - `<meta charset="UTF-8">`
    - A `<title>` of your choice.
    - A favicon (you can use any `.ico` image).
    - A `<link>` to an external CSS file called `style.css` (you can create it later).
    - A meta description about your page.
3. Open the file in your browser and check:
    - The page title appears in the browser tab.
    - The favicon shows next to the title. -->

<!-- Exercise 2-2:
1. Inside the `<body>` of your `about.html`:
    - Add an `<h2>` with the text “About Me” and a paragraph about yourself.
    - Above the `<h2>`, insert a comment describing what this section is for.
    - Add another comment that **temporarily disables** a paragraph by commenting it out.
2. Refresh the browser and verify that the commented-out paragraph doesn’t appear. -->

<!-- Exercise 2-3:
1. In the `about.html` file:
    - Write a paragraph introducing yourself, making your name **bold** using `<strong>`.
    - Emphasize one hobby with `<em>`.
    - Highlight your favorite quote with `<mark>`.
    - Show a chemical formula (e.g., H<sub>2</sub>O) and a math equation (e.g., x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup>).
    - Include an example of `<del>` and `<ins>` to show something you changed about yourself. -->

<!-- Exercise 2-4:
1. After your about section, insert `<hr>` to separate it from the next part.
2. Use `<pre>` to display:
    - A short poem, OR
    - A small code snippet (for example, HTML structure code).
3. Inside `<pre>`, try aligning text differently with spaces and tabs — notice how it preserves formatting. -->

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p><strong>Hanan Othman</strong> is my name, and I have a deep love for coding.
        One of my favorite hobbies is <em>Swimming</em>, as it allows me to relax and stay fit.
        My favorite quote is <mark>"It is during our darkest moments that we must focus to see the light."</mark> - Aristotle.
        In chemistry, water is represented as H<sub>2</sub>O,
        and in mathematics, the equation x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> = z<sup>2</sup> represents the Pythagorean
        theorem.
        I used to be shy about public speaking, but I have <del>overcome that fear</del> <ins>become confident</ins> and
        now enjoy sharing my knowledge with others.</p>
